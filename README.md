# Overview

This was something I've done because I had some spare time and was curios on how difficult it is to create an working chess-game from scratch.

Sadly to this day I havent found the time to finish this project, someday maybe I'll get back to it.

# Setup

To run this you only need to serve all the files via a webserver. I always use Liveserver, which is an extention in VS Code.

Then just press "start game" and a chess board will be generated.
